<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Christian, Indonesian, Javanese (unfortunately, I cannot speak the Javanese dialect), who spent 12 years living in Japan.</p>
<p>I am an introvert, who prefers to talk in person or in small group, instead of in large group settings. </p>
<p>I am a husband & a dad, who loves spending my weekends & holidays with my wife & kid. I really enjoy playing with my 8-years-old boy.</p>
<p>I love music, esp. jazz and rock music. I occassionally play the guitar as a hobby.</p>
<p>I spent 10 years+ in sales/marketing and business development. But I think I'm more wired to think like an engineer.</p>
<p>I like to learn new things. I'm currently learning stock investment & trading, and web development (just started)</p>
